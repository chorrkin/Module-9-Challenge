# SQL Challenge â€“ Employee Database Analysis

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Week 9 Module Challenge**, using a fictional employee database. The goal was to design a relational database schema, import raw CSV data, and perform SQL queries to analyze employee information.

## Process

- Created tables based on provided CSV files using PostgreSQL.
- Imported data into the appropriate tables.
- Established relationships using primary and foreign keys.
- Queried the database to answer a series of business questions.
- Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure (screenshot included).

## Queries Performed

The following SQL queries were used to extract insights:

1. **List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary** of each employee.
2. **List the first name, last name, and hire date** for employees hired in 1986.
3. **List the department manager** for each department, including department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. **List the department number for each employee** along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. **List employees named Hercules** whose last names begin with 'B', including their first name, last name, and sex.
6. **List all employees in the Sales department**, showing their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. **List all employees in the Sales and Development departments**, including their department name.
8. **List the frequency of employee last names** in descending order (i.e., how many employees share each last name).
